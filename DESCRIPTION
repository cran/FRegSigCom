Version: 0.2.1
Author: Ruiyan Luo, Xin Qi
Maintainer: Ruiyan Luo <rluo@gsu.edu>
Description: Signal compression methods for function-on-function (FOF) regression with functional response and functional predictors, including linear models with both scalar and functional predictors for a small number of functional predictors, linear models with functional predictors for a large number of functional predictors, stepwise selection for FOF models with two-way interactions, and nonlinear models.
