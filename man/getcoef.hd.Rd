\value{a list containing
 \item{mu }{the vector of estimated values for \eqn{\mu(t)} at \eqn{t.y}, the vector of observation time points for the response function.}
\item{beta }{ a list of length \eqn{p}, the number of functional predictors. Its \eqn{i}-th element is a matrix of the estimated values of \eqn{\beta_i(s,t)} at the full grid of observaion time points created by arguments \eqn{t.x.list[[i]]} and \eqn{t.y}  for \code{\link{cv.hd}}. }
